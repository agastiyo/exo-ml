\section{Introduction}

Since the first discovery of exoplanets by \textbf{[citet here]}, over 200 unique exoplanets have been discovered. From these discoveries, patterns in the characteristics of the exoplanets' host stars have emerged, though it is still impossible to determine with certainty if a star is a host star. 

\section{Literature}

\citet{udryStatisticalPropertiesExoplanets2007} provides a comprehensive review of work
