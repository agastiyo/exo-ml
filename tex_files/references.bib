  abstract = {The rotation periods of the host stars of extrasolar planets have been assessed against those of the Mount Wilson stars, open cluster stars, and evolutionary stellar models that include rotation. They appear to be normal, modulo certain inconsistencies in various necessary inputs. Selection of candidate planet hosts for radial velocity surveys by low rotation or activity has resulted in a planet host sample skewed toward older stars. Thus, cross-comparisons must be age-dependent. However, self-consistent ages are difficult to obtain, and activity ages show signs of systematic errors. There are indications that activity ages ought to be increased for subsolar mass stars and decreased for supersolar mass stars. Age uncertainties and a scarcity of measured rotation periods for planet host stars inflate the dispersion in older stars relative to those in open clusters. The presently available rotational models display inadequacies, most notably in producing fast enough early-type stars. The fact that only one planet host star, {$\tau$} Boo, strongly suggests tidal spin-up, while on the order of 10 systems suggest orbital circularization is explicable in terms of the differing timescales for these two phenomena. The rotational normalcy of the planet host stars and other considerations suggest that they are not especially different from other main-sequence stars and that circumstellar matter and/or planets are probably ubiquitous, at least among sufficiently metal-rich solar-type stars.},

Moreover, studies based on the distribution of rotational periods of solar-type stars suggest a possible link between lithium depletion and the rotational history of exoplanet-host stars.\emph{Aims. {$<$}i/{$>$}The effects of rotation and magnetic fields on the surface abundances of solar-type stars are studied in order to investigate whether the reported difference in lithium content of exoplanet-host stars can be related to their rotational history. Moreover, the asteroseismic properties predicted for stars with and without exoplanets are compared to determine how such a scenario, which relates the lithium abundances and the rotational history of the star, can be further challenged by observations of solar-like oscillations.\emph{Methods. {$<$}i/{$>$}Based on observations of rotational periods of solar-type stars, slow rotators on the zero age main sequence (ZAMS) are modelled with a comprehensive treatment of only the shellular rotation, while fast rotators are modelled including both shellular rotation and magnetic fields. Assuming a possible link between low rotation rates on the ZAMS and the presence of planets as a result of a longer disc-locking phase during the pre-main sequence (PMS), we compare the surface abundances and asteroseismic properties of slow and fast rotating models, which correspond to exoplanet-host stars and stars without detected planets, respectively.\emph{Results. {$<$}i/{$>$}We confirm previous suggestions that the difference in the lithium content of stars with and without detected planets can be related to their different rotational history. The larger efficiency of rotational mixing predicted in exoplanet-host stars explains their lithium depletion and also leads to changes in the structure and chemical composition of the central stellar layers. Asteroseismic observations can reveal these changes and can help us distinguish between different possible explanations for the lower lithium content of exoplanet-host stars.}}}}},

In this study we report on spectroscopic abundance analyses of {$\nu$} And and {$\tau$} Boo. Both stars are metal-rich relative to the Sun, with a mean [Fe/H] value near 0.25. These findings follow the trend set by two other planetary system candidates, {$\rho$}1 55 Cnc and 51 Peg, which also display metallicities much higher than the average for nearby dwarfs. In addition, their companions share similar orbital characteristics. Given these observations, we propose that the current metallicities of these four stars are not representative of that of the original interstellar clouds from which they formed but, rather, are the result of self-pollution during the planet formation epoch early in their histories.},

  abstract = {Stars similar to the Sun in age, mass and composition show a wide range of lithium abundances, which is hard to explain. The surface lithium abundance of the Sun itself is 140 times less than the primordial Solar System value, yet the Sun's surface convective zone is thought not to extend far enough into the interior to reach regions where lithium can get hot enough to be burned. A new survey of Sun-like stars with and without detected planets now suggests that the planets may hold the key to the Sun's missing lithium. The stars with planets have less than 1\% of the primordial lithium abundance, whereas those with no detected planets range more widely, with half of them having about 10\% of primordial abundance. It is possible that the presence of protoplanets increases mixing in the stellar disk so that lithium reaches interior regions where the temperatures are sufficient to destroy it.},

  abstract = {Results of photometric surveys have brought to light the existence of a population of giant planets orbiting their host stars even closer than the hot Jupiters (HJ), with orbital periods below 3 days. The reason why radial velocity surveys were not able to detect these very-hot Jupiters (VHJ) is under discussion. A possible explanation is that these close-in planets are short-lived, being evaporated on short time-scales due to UV flux of their host stars. In this case, stars hosting transiting VHJ planets would be systematically younger than those in the radial velocity sample. We have used the UVES spectrograph (VLT-UT2 telescope) to obtain high resolution spectra of 5 faint stars hosting transiting planets, namely, OGLE-TR-10, 56, 111, 113 and TrES-1. Previously obtained CORALIE spectra of HD189733, and published data on the other transiting planet-hosts were also used. The immediate objective is to estimate ages via Li abundances, using the Ca II activity-age relation, and from the analysis of the stellar rotational velocity. For the stars for which we have spectra, Li abundances were computed as in Israelian et al. (2004, A\&A, 414, 601) using the stellar parameters derived in Santos et al. (2006, A\&A, 450, 825). The chromospheric activity index \emph{S{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{US{$<$}sub/{$>$} was built as the ratio of the flux within the core of the Ca II H \& K lines and the flux in two nearby continuum regions. The index \emph{S{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{US{$<$}sub/{$>$} was calibrated to Mount Wilson index \emph{S{$<$}i/{$>$}\textsubscript{MW{$<$}sub/{$>$} allowing the computation of the Ca II H \& K corrected for the photospheric contribution. These values were then used to derive the ages by means of the Henry et al. (1996) activity-age relation. Bearing in mind the limitations of the ages derived by Li abundances, chromospheric activity, and stellar rotational velocities, none of the stars studied in this paper seem to be younger than 0.5 Gyr.}}}}}}},

We isolate the effects of mass and metallicity on the occurrence rate trend with age, but find the results to be inconclusive, due to weak trends and the small sample size. Our results hint that the exoplanet occurrence rate may decrease over time due to dynamical instability from planet--planet scattering or planet ejection, but accurate ages and larger sample sizes are needed to resolve a clear relation between the occurrence rate and age.},

The radial-velocity residuals around the Keplerian solution are 1.3 m s\textsuperscript{-1{$<$}sup/{$>$}, demonstrating the very high quality of the HARPS measurements. Activity and bisector indicators exclude any significant perturbations of stellar intrinsic origin, which supports the planetary interpretation. Contrary to most planet-host stars, HD 4308 has a marked sub-solar metallicity ([Fe/H] = -0.31), raising the possibility that very light planet occurrence might show a different coupling with the parent star's metallicity than do giant gaseous extra-solar planets. Together with Neptune-mass planets close to their parent stars, the new planet occupies a position in the mass-separation parameter space that is constraining for planet-formation and evolution theories.
